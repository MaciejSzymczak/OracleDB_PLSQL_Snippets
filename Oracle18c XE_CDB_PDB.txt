For 18c XE the connection string is 127.0.0.1:1521/XEPDB1 (do not use 127.0.0.1:1521/XE)
==========================================================================================
 
Why:
Oracle 12 onward is multi tenancy DB, which means several isolated, independent pdb’s (pdb for pluggable database) can be installed on single engine (cdb).
Pdb is just separate database with its own public synonyms, schemat etc. It inherits cdb users. 
The change was introduced to give the possibility of better maintenance of several databases.
Pdb can be easily created, clonned etc.
Once 18c XE is installed it contains one pdb, the XEPDB1 one, and one cdb XE.
Each pdb has its individual tnsname.
The trick to connecting to a pluggable database (pdb) is to know the TNS service name.
While login to  127.0.0.1:1521/XEPDB1 you login do pdb. 
While login to 127.0.0.1:1521/XE you login to cdb.
Cbd as a limitations like the user name must start from c## and cannot be used as such.
Do not use not supported tricks like (it works but this not supported)
prompt Oracle 18c http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_ora_65096_create_user_12c_without_c_prefix.htm
alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;
 
Other details:
Checking current pdb name
SELECT SYS_CONTEXT (‘USERENV’, ‘CON_NAME’) FROM DUAL;
 
Changing active pdb:
alter session set container = nameofyourpluggabledatabase
 
List of pdb:
SELECT NAME, CON_ID, CON_UID FROM V$PDBS ORDER BY CON_ID;
 
List of cdb (yeah, there can be many, I didnt mention it):
SELECT NAME, CON_ID, CON_UID FROM V$CONTAINERS ORDER BY CON_ID;

On the occasion of an error like: The wizzard was interrupted before Oracle 18c XE could be completely installed:
==================================================================================================================
 
Check logs (if any) here  C:\app\Maciek\product
Check logs is any here C:\app\Maciek\cfgtoollogs
Check HD available space, restart
Delete any suspicious environment variable like %oracle%, TNS
Delete all oracle folders from HD
Run setup.exe rather than Oracle Database 18c Express Edition.msi
